# IMDB-Movie-Rating-Predictive-Model
tried to predict movie ration using KNN, CART, Random Forest.
Worked on building a predictive model by considering multicollinearity and other Machine learning concepts related to  factors or variables using R programming. 

How can we tell the greatness of a movie before it is released in cinema?

This question arises as there is no universal way to claim the goodness of movies. Many people rely on critics to gauge the quality of a film, while others use their instincts. But it takes the time to obtain a reasonable amount of critics review after a movie is released. And human instinct sometimes is unreliable.

Given that thousands of movies were produced each year, is there a better way for us to tell the greatness of movie without relying on critics or our own instincts?

To answer this question, we tried to predict using KNN, CART, Random Forest.

It is so hard to find the rating of movie before it is released in the theatres. We are hence predicting Ratings based on different factors such as Actor,Director Facebook likes, Critic Reviews, Budget and Gross money spent on movie, IMDB Score.
